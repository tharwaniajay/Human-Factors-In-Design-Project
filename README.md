# Human-Factors-In-Design-Project
  Problem statement: Redesigning the existing locking systems in bicycles in order to make it ergonomically more viable
  
  This project is dedicated to fabricate a new mechanism from an anthropometrical and ergonomics perspective, which can replace the current bicycle locking mechanisms that need the user to get down, which can be time consuming, inconvenient and requires considerable mechanical work.
  
  The repository contains a final report and a CAD video, which gives a detailed description of the human factors apporoach that went into finding a more efficient mechanism and a representaion of how the new mechanism would work through the video.
